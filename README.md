# Median housing value prediction

The housing data can be downloaded from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ageron/handson-ml/master/. The script has codes to download the data. We have modelled the median house value on given housing data. 

The following techniques have been used: 

 - Linear regression
 - Decision Tree
 - Random Forest

## Steps performed
 - We prepare and clean the data. We check and impute for missing values.
 - Different encoding techniques are used and to convert categorical columns into numerical
 - EDA is performed on housing data & The data set is split into train and test.
 - Different regression models(Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Support Vector Regressor) are used and evaluated performance metrics.
 - Random Search CV and grid search CV techniques are used for hyperparameter tuning
 - Column transformers are used to create new features and robustify code.
